# Google Play Store EDA 

# Project Overview
This project combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques on two distinct datasets:

1.Google Play Store Dataset: The goal is to perform EDA, clean the data, and prepare it for potential future predictive modeling studies.
2.Honey Production Dataset: This dataset focuses on U.S. honey production from 1998 to 2012, and the aim is to visualize trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

# Datasets

1.Google Play Store Dataset: This dataset contains information on various apps available on the Google Play Store. The attributes include app names, categories, ratings, reviews, sizes, installs, and more.
Dataset Source: Kaggle - Google Play Store Apps

2.Honey Production Dataset: This dataset tracks honey production in the U.S. from 1998 to 2012. It contains information on production volumes, the number of colonies, yield per colony, and the price per pound of honey.
Dataset Source: Kaggle - Honey Production

# Key Objectives

1. Google Play Store Dataset
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data entries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze distributions, correlations, and outliers to draw insights from the data.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for future predictive modeling by handling categorical data, normalizing numerical data, and more.

2. Honey Production Dataset
Data Visualization: Utilize Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize trends in honey production over time, such as:
Changes in production volumes across the years
Trends in the number of colonies
Price fluctuations over time

# Key Libraries Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
Numpy: For numerical operations
Seaborn: For creating visualizations
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and visualization

# Exploratory Data Analysis (Google Play Store)

The following steps were performed for EDA:

Data Cleaning: Removed null values, duplicates, and handled inconsistent data.

Insights:
Most popular app categories based on installs and reviews
Distribution of app ratings and reviews
Relationships between app size, installs, and ratings

# Data Visualization (Honey Production)

Visualizations created include:
Annual honey production trends
Colony counts per year and corresponding yield
Price per pound trends across years

# Future Work
Predictive modeling using cleaned Google Play Store data (e.g., predicting app ratings).
Further analysis of honey production trends with advanced time series models.
